# Hashing Experiments
I came across [SHAllenge](https://shallenge.quirino.net/) and decided to 
create my own on my website [www.taxborn.com/sha](https://www.taxborn.com/sha). 
I also wanted to create my own program to generate SHA256 (and other) hashes easily and
as fast as possible.

### Current speeds
:desktop_computer: **CPU:** i7-13700k

:tv: **GPU:** Radeon RX 7900 XT

:desktop_computer: [hashslingingslasher](hashslingingslasher/) - 5.5 MH/s Single-threaded
