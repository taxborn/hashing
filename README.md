# Hashing Experiments
I came across [SHAllenge](https://shallenge.quirino.net/) and decided to 
create my own on my website [www.taxborn.com/sha](https://www.taxborn.com/sha). 
I also wanted to create my own program to generate SHA256 (and other) hashes easily and
as fast as possible.

#### Hardware
:desktop_computer: **CPU:** i7-13700k

:tv: **GPU:** Radeon RX 7900 XT

## Current programs
:desktop_computer: [hss](hss/) - ~240 MH/s Multi-threaded Rust Program

:desktop_computer: [hashslingingslasher](hashslingingslasher/) - 5.5 MH/s Single-threaded Rust Program

:desktop_computer: [main.c](main.c) - 7 MH/s Mutli-threaded C program

:desktop_computer: [sha.py](sha.py) - ~2.4 MH/s Single-threaded Python Program
